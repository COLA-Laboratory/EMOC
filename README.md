</div>

EMOC stands for **E**volutionary **M**ulti-objective **O**ptimization in **C**++ which is a framework for single-objective and multi-objective optimization. 

For more information about installation and usage, please refer to the [document site](https://cola-laboratory.github.io/EMOCDoc/).


## Features

- **Rich algorithms and problems**

  EMOC implemented about 30 algorithms and more than 80 test problems which both include single-objective and multi-objective types.

- **Developed in C++ and Cross-platform**

  All the source code of EMOC are wrote in C++. So the running efficiency is guaranteed when comparing other implementation with python, java or matlab. We also provide cross-platform compatibility for users with different operator systems.

- **Friendly GUI**

  EMOC provides a user-friendly GUI with the function of configuring parameters of once-run and experiments without writing a single line of code.

- **Various Optimization Types**

  EMOC supports unconstraint optimization, constraint optimization and combinatorial optimization (including binary encoding and permutation encoding).

- **Save into Excel or Latex**

  Users can save the experiment results of EMOC in the format of Excel or Latex.
